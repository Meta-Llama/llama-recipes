However, given the premise of the question, which suggests increasing the federal funds rate to move the economy closer to full employment (which is counterintuitive), the appropriate action to decrease aggregate demand (if the goal was to fight inflation, for example) would be to sell bonds.\n\nSelling bonds decreases the money supply because because it absorbs liquidity from the financial system, reducing the amount of money available for lending and spending.

Vestibule training is a type of training that occurs in a controlled environment, simulating the actual work conditions. It's most beneficial for jobs that require specific, often technical or high-risk skills, where training on the job could be dangerous or impractical.\n\nGiven the options:\n- Receptionist: Typically involves front-desk duties, customer service, and administrative tasks, which might not require simulated training.\n- Word processor: Involves typing and document preparation, skills that can often be learned through traditional training methods.\n- High school teacher: While teaching is a complex profession, the training for teachers usually involves a combination of academic study and practice in real classroom settings, rather than vestibule training.\n- Clinical psychologist: Requires extensive academic and clinical training, which includes supervised practice but is not typically described as vestibule training.\n- Software developer: Might involve some form of simulated training, but the nature of software development often allows for on-the-job learning and traditional forms of training.\n- Salesperson: Training for sales often involves role-playing and simulated customer interactions, which could be considered a form of vestibule training, but it's not the most critical or high-stakes profession listed.\n- Newspaper journalist: Involves writing, reporting, and potentially dangerous situations, but training is often through apprenticeships or on-the-job experience rather than vestibule training.\n- Airline pilot: Requires extensive training in a simulated environment (flight simulators) to ensure safety and proficiency. This is a critical example of vestibule training.\n- Bus driver: While driving a bus requires a license and some training, it's less likely to involve the kind of simulated environment training that vestibule training implies, compared to flying an airplane.\n- Restaurant waiter: Involves customer service and food service skills, which are typically learned through on-the-job training rather than vestibule training.\n\nConsidering the need for a controlled, simulated environment to learn and practice skills safely, the job of an airline pilot stands out as the most likely candidate for vestibule training.\n\nThe best answer is H."]], "filtered_resps": ["H"], "doc_hash": "24c36f2411122088fb84f55efa13950dfea2fd944a266ac1196d5bb14c79379a", "prompt_hash": "63bb1ba3faa2a2dcd684b91b3e09734cd49ea858250cb36b650eb5d10345077a", "target_hash": "44bd7ae60f478fae1061e11a7739f4b94d1daf917982d33b6fc8a01a63f89c21", "exact_match": 1.0}

What has research indicated about this type of conditioning?\nA. Simultaneous conditioning is a respondent conditioning procedure where the CS is presented continuously, and the UCS is presented within five seconds of the onset of the CS. This setup leads to the quickest and easiest learning of the CR. However, a delay of about 1/2 a second between the onset of a CS and the UCS produces the fastest learning.\nB. In simultaneous conditioning, the UCS is presented before the CS.\nC. Simultaneous conditioning requires a long delay between the CS and the UCS.\nD. Simultaneous conditioning occurs when the conditioned stimulus is presented several minutes before the unconditioned stimulus, resulting in weak learning.\nE. Simultaneous conditioning is a procedure where the conditioned stimulus is presented for a brief moment, followed by the unconditioned stimulus after a significant delay, usually reducing the effectiveness of conditioning.\nF. Simultaneous conditioning involves multiple conditioned stimuli presented at the same time, each followed by the unconditioned stimulus.\nG. In simultaneous conditioning, the unconditioned stimulus and conditioned stimulus are presented at random intervals, leading to variable learning outcomes.\nH. Simultaneous conditioning is the slowest form of learning.\nI. Simultaneous conditioning is a classical conditioning method where the conditioned stimulus and unconditioned stimulus are presented in alternating sessions, not concurrently.\nJ. Simultaneous conditioning is a type of operant conditioning that requires reinforcement to be given at the same time as the behavior.\n\nYour response should end with \"The best answer is [the_answer_letter].\" where the [the_answer_letter] is a letter from the provided choices.\n\nLet's think step by step.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n"], "previously_is_correct": true, "input_question_hash": "50c75573b088726c49598433cfd84de024ebd7531aa7e417d3d1de81dfd88807", "input_choice_list": {"A": "Simultaneous conditioning is a respondent conditioning procedure where the CS is presented continuously, and the UCS is presented within five seconds of the onset of the CS.
