# End to End Example using Llama models for Multi-Modal RAG 

This is a series of notebooks that can be used for a self-paced workshop or course/learning to understand how to build Multi-Modal RAG using Llama 3.2-11B model. 

Here's the outline:

- Step 1: Data Prep and Synthetic Labeling using 11B model
- Step 2: Cleaning up Synthetic Labels and preparing the dataset
- Step 3: Notebook 3: MM-RAG using lance-db to validate idea
- Step 4: Gradio App using Together API for Llama-3.2-11B and Lance-db for RAG
